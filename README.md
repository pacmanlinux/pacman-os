PacMan Linux is a versatile, lightweight  Arch-based distribution designed primarily as a **Dev-Workstation** using the 'Budgie Desktop' with a strong foundation of dev-tools and software. - Plus a curated set of essential cybersecurity tools. 

Its perfect for programmers, sysadmins, security researchers and power users who want a flexible, secure and performance-optimized OS without unnecessary bloat.
